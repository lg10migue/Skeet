# Skeet
Skeet is game that simulates skeet shooting. On the left side of the screen, clay pigeons, or targets are randomly thrown across the screen. On the bottom left corner of the screen, the "marksman" (the term is used very loosely here) aims the rifle. The object of the game is to hit the intended targets, and not other "safe" ones.

This version it is based on the Disney movie: Wall·E. Protect Eva from enemy robots by shooting at them trash cans.

Targets:
Eva ( Safe Target ) = -10 points.
Green robot ( Bonus Target ) = 15 points.
Pink robot ( Standart Target ) = 1 point.
White robot ( Strong Target ) = 7 points ( 3 lives, 1 point for the first two lives, 5 points for the last live ).

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
